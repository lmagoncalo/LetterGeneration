## Evaluating the quality of a typeface

- Good technical quality of the drawing/outlines, e.g. continuous curves, even rounds, no bumps or corners where straights enter into curves. **(Xing Loss)**

- Even stroke thickness fitting the design of the typeface

- Related proportions of related characters (n/m/h, b/d/p/q, O/C/G/Q etc.)

- Similar detailing across characters (treatment of related parts, serifs, bowls, extenders) **(Perceptual Loss & CLIP Similarity Loss)**

- Optical compensations, e.g. slightly larger rounds, overshoots, thinning of strokes at joints, optical middle, verticals slightly thicker etc.

- Harmonious spacing that fits the design, i.e. fitting the size of counters, optically even space between all glyphs, not too tight or too loose for the intended size of use

- Individual spacing adjustment of tricky glyph combinations where needed (= kerning). A high number of kerning pairs does not equal high quality; it may in fact indicate spacing flaws

- A wordspace that fits proportions of the design. Many low-quality free fonts forget to even set the wordspace.

- Completeness of character-set for the task and language at hand, e.g. not missing basic symbols, accented characters, ß or œ/æ

- Well-designed diacritical characters that meet standards of native speakers, e.g. regarding size and position of accents, appropriate [historical] form of diacritics that fit the design

- Fitting design of auxiliary characters like punctuation, numerals, currency symbols etc. (not just copied over from other fonts) **(Perceptual Loss & CLIP Similarity Loss)**

- Appropriate vertical dimensions, i.e. no clipping on websites, no overlapping extenders when set solid, not too much line spacing

- Functioning OpenType features, if included, that follow the OT-specifications

- Basic, if only automatic, hinting for reasonable rendering on Windows systems

- Related styles that fit together as a family, share design details and proportions. Just one single weight makes a typeface less useful for more complex design
